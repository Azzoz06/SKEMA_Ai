4	Thank you thank you thank you !! I  want to thank the people that made this place happen ....you have made all my dreams come true. Imagine a delicious yogurt shop with super fun flavors like peanut butter, chocolate mint, cake batter and so many more.  I used to have to travel to  Yogurtland or Jujuberry  but not anymore , now we have one right in the hood!! Guess what?   instead of eating a normal lunch I can pig out with a healthy peanut butter yogurt smothered in chocolate chips.   Could be the perfect lunch!!  See you there!
5	A Humane Society store at the Biltmore?  Interesting.  I had seen an adorable chihuahua mix at the Humane Society's webpage, and headed over to check out the little dog and the store.  They sell a variety of toys, treats, leashes, collars, and foods- in short, they sell a little bit of everything.  There's no tax, and if you adopt a pet from them they will give you 10% off the price as a thank you.  When I went there were 4 dogs up for adoption, a rabbit, and a wall of cats.  The little chihuahua mix was hanging out in the store with another little dog, so we got to play with them for a little bit.  The staff were friendly, and weren't pushy or hovering.  \n\nIn the end, we did end up adopting that little chihuahua mix from here.  He's the sweetest little dog ever.  Thank you Petique!
1	Don't buy Nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them.. I've bought many from them. I went this week  and bought 2 pairs of Nike SB's that were already over retail price as it is.. I tried on one side then bought them... When I got home I realized that one of the shoes were damaged.. It's only been 2 days and they said they can't take it back.. I've bought many shoes there and this will be the last time... I'm from Nor Cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within 14- 30 days.. This was the first place that does not do that.. Why? Because sneakers and SB's are not big in AZ... They don't sell here.. I wouldn't buy them there if I were you.
3	I have to say I love most things about Sprouts and especially this particular store, it's clean & has a nice selection of environmentally thoughtful & healthier products. I know you might hear a BUT coming & unfortunately there is. On our last trip there we discovered that in the bulk section, some of the foods are made with partially hydrogenated oils!!!!! That is a definite fail in that area! Sprouts can have good deals but because of the specialty items they carry... you can walk out of there spending a pretty penny. I am not complaining about that. BUT again we did not expect that at this kind of store we would have to think twice about looking for trans fat in their products. We will always shop there so it's not a deal breaker... just a let down. :( Maybe that is something that could be fixed?
5	The tire pressure light came on a day or so ago, so I had my husband fill the tire with more air. Took it down to Discount Tire this morning, and apparently I ran over a hunk of metal a few days ago. Although it was pretty busy in there, they fit me in and had my tire repaired in about 30-35 minutes. Cost = $0. Totally awesome. And they didn't try to sell me new tires! Love that. \n\nPlus one of the technicians in the garage was singing so loudly to Lady Gaga that he could be heard in the waiting area. Very entertaining. :)
4	Good Pizza and great service!!\nThe date dinner for two special is great for its value, available on Thursdays after 6:00 pm!!!\n It included an entree, two salads and one pizza of your choice!!! \nEnough food for two!!! :) The garlic french fries were bomb!!!! Deliciously seasoned. As for our friend, the birthday boy, he had pepperoni pizza and that by itself was great, better than our BBQ Chicken pizza I would say!!\n Fun place, great service, AWESOME YOUNG MAN SERVING!!! :) We came here with a group of 12 and were seated urgently and smoothly!! :) Oh and the Pomegranate Martini was Oh soo Great!!! A must try, a bit strong, but that's how I like them!! :)
5	Found this place looking for a taqueria on line. I wanted authentic mexican food. NOT taco bell! I found exactly what I was looking for. I got the Carne Asada burrito. It was bigger then Chipolte's for $2.00 less! The asada was very good and lean, no fat. I was staying in the area for 5 days and found myself eating here four times! Very friendly service and clean. My son said he knew it was going to be good even before we walked in because of the mexican music playing outside, and he was right! TAQUERIA MI CASITA ROCKS!  I will definately find my way back here again.
3	Its nice to support the locals vs the big chains, however some times its a trade off. \n\nIt was nice to get free won ton chips at the table.  The upgrade to brown rice is a bit steep however at $1.\n\nThe dishes them self were decent but nothing too impressible and when you ask for hot sauce you get a small dish of chilli oil, hardly enough for a true fire head. \n\nIf you are in the area give it a try, but don't drive too far you will be just as happy or happier at a peiwei for about the same price.
5	I was so excited when I saw this place opening. We moved here from California so this was yet another thing we left behind. Fortunately all our favorites are slowly following us here. Eventually California will fall into the ocean and we'll have beach front property and we'll be set. I digress. \n\nThis BevMo particularly is really well stocked and large. Larger than a lot of California ones and the people here are all really helpful. If they don't have something in stock, they can order it for you and get it in pretty quick. They used to have a great bar in it with wine and beer tastings but it's gone now. Some problem with licensing - I'm assuming liquor license. I can empathize with the bureaucracy. I just filed our quarterly taxes and its driven me to drink - hence BevMo.\n\nEven if you have nothing in particular to buy, take a walk through. It's like Disneyland for adults. Unless you're a Mormon. Then it may not be for you. But if you're not, it's great. (Special bonus - HUGE selection of tiny liquor bottles to stash for lame dry wedding or to keep on hand for general times that require tiny bottles of booze.)
5	"""This was also my first play, sad I know! Although I missed the first half of \The Clean House\"""" I was lucky enough to find someone that caught me up to speed! We got seated on the lower level left balcony very close as soon as I sat down I pretty much laughed thru the rest of the play, it was a great story! I had no idea there was cussing in the theatre! The cast was excellent, I am also a fan of Felicity La Fortune (Lani) she appeared in a soap I used to watch I thought she was fantastic!! I missed the Wicked Bakery & Gelato spot stuff afterward's no worry's Wicked is near by and I am planning a visit soon, like tomorrow lol! Seeing the play was a treat all by itself a good time was had! Thank you Yelp and Gabi!!"""""""
5	Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.
2	We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good. \nI had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops. \nMy wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing. \nShe also had a creamsicle milkshake which tasted just like a creamsicle. Again she enjoyed it.
5	I like Chinese food. When I lived in San Francisco, I lived in the Inner Richmond (before it was run over by the Hiptards, when it was a fun Chinese neighborhood), and would go to various restaurants with a friend, Chinese, so we got taken care of all the time.\n\nNow in LA, it's more about Korean and Thai, but I still love my Chinese food.\n\nI flew in to see the parents, and we headed over to Joyful for dinner. The parents have been there a few times, and a friend of theirs is a NY'er who is fanatical about his Chinese food, and he goes once a week. \n\nSpoke to the wait staff, from Hong Kong and Macau via Vietnam and then Los Angeles. They have Cantonese and Mandarin style, as well as a few Thai and curry dishes.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls, vegetable egg rolls, vegetable egg foo young, beef chow mein and chicken moo shu. All were amazingly good, and fresh. That's the key: really, really fresh.\n\nThe chow mein noodles were homemade, nice and fresh. The beef was a nice quality, and thick pieces.\n\nThe moo shu, for me, was the best. They hand roll the crepes in the back, coming out in tightly wound roll. The chicken and vegetables were nice and fresh, white meat. And the extra hoison sauce was perfect.\n\nAnd they give you almond cookies and fortune cookies at the end, which isn't really Chinese but who cares. :)\n\nAll in all, it's a four and half star place. The fifth star, however, is to offset Lauren. Sorry you didn't get utensils, but really the food is much better than 2 stars. And, the hotel should have been able to supply you with fork, knife and spoon ... just tip the bell boy $2 and you would have been set.
5	AMAZING FOOD! Yes there is a long wait (2-3 Hours sometimes) but if you can't find any friends that you would like to spend a few hours with next door at the bar drinking wine and eating a cheese platter and some olives, then maybe you should just call for delivery and stay in your cave.  The ingredients are minimal on your pizza but you can' TASTE the freshness, and that beats all greasy and heavy pizza in my book! So come prepared to wait, but Bar Bianco, which is less than 20 steps away will help entertain you while you wait. Food and service are exceptional!
5	Last night we attended the  summer night time activities for kids held on Fridays  form 6-9 during the summer. We had a great time, the kids had water  blow up slides to play on , water play , Phoenix Youth theater acts, \nfun  family music.   They have only one more Friday left this summer, so come out and have fun. There was a lovely breeze by about 7:00  and the sun  stopped heating it up. \n\nAlways love the zoo, they seem to be getting more and more exhibits and animals.  I recommend going at the beginning of the day or end of the day. That's when many animals come out to play , feed and  water. \nLast  night we  saw the family of wild dogs playing and hanging out  also saw the cheetahs which was  a treat , they usually hide to camouflage .\n\nThe zoo is equipped with clean bathrooms, lots of places  for breaks and hanging out. We have had two birthday parties there and the kids loved it. \n\nThe kids wanted a ride on the tram which was nice in the evening , we learned new facts from the guide and a little about the Zoo's work on keeping many animals from becoming extinct.\n\nMy 9 year old and my best friends 10 year old have been coming here since they were 2 and 3 . They love coming here and never seem to tire of it\n\n We visit the zoo about every two months just to check out what the animals are doing.  You can bring in your own food, wagons, bikes and stay all day . For little ones there is a huge tree house to play in  and a water splash place for summer.
4	"""Regency has been in Ahwatukee for as long as I can remember, and I've been here a long time!  The staff is super friendly; they recognize me as soon as I walk in the door and even know who my parents are (who have been going there forever) and tell me that they stopped in earlier in the week.  They do alterations too!\n\nThe prices are a little high, this isn't your $2/item dry cleaner.  I've used those places before and I believe you get what you pay for.  For example, they look for spots/stains before they clean my clothes, I don't have to call special attention to them.  Regency catches the stains that I miss!!  The $2 place never did that!\n\nAlso, they use earth friendly cleaning products/process.  To me that makes my money worth it and it also makes me think twice before getting something dry cleaned.  \Can I get one more wear out of those dress pants?  Its not like I went hiking in them . . . yeah, I can wait.\""""\n\nAs we've all heard before, we vote with our dollars, and I vote for the local, friendly dry cleaner that cares about the planet!"""""""
4	"""Service and food is excellent.  $3.99 for a good sized burrito served with rice and beans on the side is a great deal.  Or 99 cent tacos (these are the Mexico \street\"""" style ones served on a soft flat corn tortilla).  All their food is very authentic.\n\nThe Al Pastor (seasoned grilled pork and onions) is my favorite and is the best I've ever had.  Whether it's in a burrito, taco or torta, I absolutely love it.  The sodas are the kind you'd get in Mexico.. they import them in the glass bottles.  I've always liked these better than the plastic bottle type you get in the states. The Mexican ones are sweeter and less carbonated.\n\nGreat place, and they have beer too."""""""
4	"""Let's talk about the good things at Moto.\n\n1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with \typical\"""" beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their \""""lite\"""" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies. \n\nAlong with the beer comes an in-frequent \""""beer celebration\"""" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event. \n\n\n2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be \""""to-go\"""" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3\"""" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.\n\nI've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.\n\n\n3. Desert - The \""""Mojos\"""" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.\n\n\n4. The \""""Underground\"""" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving. \n\n\n5. The \""""all you can eat\"""" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.\n\n\nAnd now the downside:\n\n1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the \""""rice bloat\"""" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an \""""underground\"""" roll (mentioned above).\n\n\n2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.\n\n\n\nThat's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a \""""sushi experience\"""", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers."""""""
4	We Finlay made it to St Francis. My girlfriend and I came here for dinner New Years eve for dinner before heading to a party. We both went with the 3 course meal that night. She got the salad that had thinly slice grapefruit and a light but tasty vinaigrette. I choose the lobster bisque. This lobster bisque was so good except one thing, they put thinly sliced pecans in it. This is not a place for nuts. I had a few bites of it before I got the pecans and it was delicious. Once i chewed the nuts it coated my mouth and that was all I could taste for the rest of the bowl. Leave the nuts out next time it was so good!!! Course #2 She got the scallops. Freakin awsome and cooked to perfection! I have never had a scallop cook so perfect ever. Props to who ever was cooking the scallops that night! I ordered the fillet. I ordered it med rare and it was more like med+ and I took one bite and decided to keep it cause it was delicious and they were busy and didn't want to wait 15 min for another. I usually would have sent it back but the flavor was there and the veggies that came with were excellent. For the desserts she got pear dessert with ice cream. Freakin awsome. Great thing to have for cleansing the palate after all that great food. I got the Chocolate turtle dessert that was great but we took that home for later. The building is cool and for the firs timers the waiter gives you a little history about the building before ordering. Great service and great food. We will be back and cant wait to see whats on the menu next time we stop by!
4	Uncle Bear's is one of the best things about Queen Creek! \n\nThe food is actually decent pub grub. The vibe is laid back, festive, friendly, and warm. The locals that frequent the place are definitely life of the party. The dog wall of fame is very sweet. The RIP wall made me tear up for my recently lost dog. When you're in this joint, you feel dinstinctly like you're in a beach town in San Diego, rather than a tiny suburb in AZ. \n\nI recommend you swing by. If you come a few times, everyone will know you and you'll feel like you're walking into a really fun living room.
