# Artificial Intelligence

In this 2.5 days course you will learn the fundamentals of **Artificial Intelligence**. It will provide you the base knowledge to start growing your Data Science, AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills, whether you are a deep technical expert or not.  
Everyone wants to become a Data Scientist, it is one of the sexy jobs in the IT Industry outthere but skills are critical.  
This course will address Data Science from two point of views:
1. The clickers:
2. The coders:

## Agenda
### Day one
+ Introduction
  + Agenda Presentation & Evaluation Process
+ Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals
  + What is AI?
  + Machine Learning
  + Industry Use Cases
+ IBM Watson AI Platform (Services & Tools)

+ **Hands-on Labs** – Machine Learning 101  « The Clickers way » [here](Labs/DayOneLabs/Lab1-GettingStarted.md) - *This Lab is going to walk you thru the setting of your environment, instantiation of the Watson Studio service and basic data exploration, data visualization and data refinery tasks.* ***You don't need to complete the entire data refinery part***
+ **Hands-on Labs** – Machine Learning 101  « The Clickers way » [here](Labs/DayOneLabs/Lab2-WatsonML_Model_Builder.md) *This lab is going to walk you through the creation of your first **Machine Learning model.** *It will predict the likelihood of a customer to churn for a Telco company*  

+ **Hands on Labs** – Machine Learning «  The Coders way »


### Day Two (half day)
+ Computer Vision
+ **Hands on Labs** – Visual Recognition using the IBM Watson Visual Recognition service. This is the *clickers* approach available [here](Labs/DayTwoLabs/Lab1%20-%20Using%20Visual%20Recognition%20with%20UI/README.md)  
+ Deep Learning fundamentals
+ **Hands on Labs** - Deep Learning for image recognition. This lab is going to walk you through the process of building Neural Networks to recognize hand written digits in different ways:
  1. Using Visual Recognition Service [here](Labs/Lab6-DL_VisualReco/Lab6-DL-Custom_VR/Lab6-Custom_Visual_Reco.md)
  2. Using a CNN [here](Labs/DayTwoLabs/Lab6-DL_VisualReco/Lab6-DL-HandWritten_CNN_ART/README.md)
  3. Building a NN in a Jupyter Notebook [here](Labs/DayTwoLabs/Lab6-DL_VisualReco/Lab6-DL-NN_Notebook/Lab6-DeepLearning_Keras_Notebook.md)
  4. Using the NN Builder from Watson Studio [here](Labs/DayTwoLabs/Lab6-DL_VisualReco/Lab6-DL-NNBuilder/README.md)
